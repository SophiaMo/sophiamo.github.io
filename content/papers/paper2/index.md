##### Abstract

We investigate the role of coworkers in shaping job mobility decisions by altering workers’ perceptionsof their outside options. Using novel survey data collected from a representative sampleof U.S. wage and salaried workers, we document two distinct channels through which currentand former coworkers influence mobility. First, having more current coworkers with prior experiencein an industry improves the accuracy of wage beliefs for that industry. Second, having morepast coworkers currently employed at a firm raises the perceived probability of receiving a job offerfrom that firm, as shown in a survey experiment that elicits subjective job-offer probabilities.We incorporate these findings into a job choice model with coworker-based learning and referraleffects. Relative to standard models that assume perfect information about wages and job opportunities, our framework demonstrates that coworker networks facilitate reallocation and reduce the welfare losses associated with informational frictions.
